Peibo Duan
Associate Professor | Master's Supervisor
Member, IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
Dr. Peibo Duan is currently an Associate Professor at the Software College of Northeastern University. He pursued his joint Ph.D. training at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia from 2015 to 2017 under the China Scholarship Council (CSC) program. He earned his first Ph.D. in Computer Science from Northeastern University (2013-2017) and a second Ph.D. in Big Data and Electronics from UTS with full scholarship (2017-2020).

Prior to joining Northeastern University in October 2020, Dr. Duan served as a Research Fellow at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He currently leads one provincial-level research project (2.9 million RMB in funding) and one industry-sponsored project. His research has yielded over 15 publications in top-tier SCI-indexed journals including IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Transportation Research, and Information Sciences.

Dr. Duan is a key member of the Intelligent Computing and Service Laboratory directed by Professor Bin Zhang, a research team comprising 12 faculty members (including professors, associate professors, and lecturers)..
